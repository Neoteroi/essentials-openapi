  ([bug report](https://github.com/Neoteroi/mkdocs-plugins/issues/35)).
- Fixes a bug related to missing resolution of references for `requestBody`;
  ([bug report](https://github.com/Neoteroi/essentials-openapi/issues/21)).
- Fixes support for code fences (disables by default `autoescape`, since the

  Those who still wants to have `autoescape` enabled with `Jinja` can do so
  setting an environment variable: `SELECT_AUTOESCAPE=1`.
